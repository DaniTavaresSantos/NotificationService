# Rate-Limited Notification Service
This is a project focused on protect recipients from getting too many emails, either due to system errors or due to abuse

## ðŸ’» Solution Proposal

This project uses Clean Architecture.

The backEnd Programming language is:
- C# .NET Core 8

It was used some tools, Technologies and Patterns to allow the solution to work:
- Docker
- SwaggerUI
- Redis
- xUnit
- FluentValidations 
- Mock
- AutoBogus
- K6
- Factory Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Result Pattern


## How to Run the App

1. Run a Docker App as Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop
2. Open the command prompt and type: 
```cmd
docker-compose build
```

3. Then, you should type 
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```
to start the application containers.

4. navigate to http://localhost:8082/swagger and use the Endpoints.

to stop containers please type 
```cmd
docker-compose down
```

## Automated Tests

### Unit Tests

For this solution I decided to implement Unit Testings for most of my Application. Achieving the coverage of 89%:

### Load Tests
I implemented Load Tests as well using K6 tool.
To run the load tests you should follow these steps:
1. Install K6 tool using the following link as guide: https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/
2. Once you are with k6 installed, open the command prompt on the project folder and type: 
```cmd
cd LoadTest
```
3. Then you should type:
```cmd
K6 run -d 10s -u 1 ./loadtest_script.js
```
4. Finally, you will see a dashboard showing how many successful requests we had with 10 seconds of constant requests using 1 virtual machine:

6. The project is configured to use a mocked request with the Request Type = Status, so It will allow only 2 requests per minute.


##  Testing with Swagger or Postman

1. Once you navigated to http://localhost:8082/swagger, you will see the Post Endpoint called Notification:
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6ff145c-7fb8-40fe-bc93-968741205871)
2. If you want to use the Rate Limit functionality you should select the value of the header field: LimitType to: RateLimited:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1c0bff9-fa9f-44f1-b1f0-aa2158e25dd9)
   - If you change the value of the header LimitType to Unlimited, there won't be limit rules applied to the request, so it will work everytime.

### Request Validations
I implemented field validations to the Notification Request so if you want to use the endpoint you should follow these rules:

- Recipient.Email: Not Empty, between 1 and 100 characters and should be a valid email.
- Recipient.Name: Not Empty, between 1 and 100 characters
- Message.Body: Not empty, between 1 and 200 characters
- Message.Title: Not empty, between 1 and 50 characters

    
3. For the body, I suggest you to use this json:
```json
    {
      "type": "Status",
      "recipient": {
        "name": "Daniel",
        "emailAdress": "dani.teste@hotmail.com"
      },
      "message": {
        "title": "Important message",
        "body": "This message is Important"
      }
    }
```
4.The field: "type" defined what will be the type of the Request: Status, News or Marketing. 
- Their Rate Limits values are:
```json
"RateLimits": {
      "Status": {
        "Limit": 2,
        "TimePeriod": "00:01:00" // 1 minute
      },
      "News": {
        "Limit": 1,
        "TimePeriod": "1.00:00:00" // 1 day
      },
      "Marketing": {
        "Limit": 3,
        "TimePeriod": "01:00:00" // 1 hour
      }
    }
```

5. Once we're testing using the type: #Status on the json example above, it will be possible to send 2 requests successfully on the Time Period of 1 minute for the emailAdress and type provided.
- If you change any of these values (emailAdress or Type) the identity of the request will be changed, and It will be possible to send more requests on the same Time Period.

# Data Storing choices
On this project I needed to choose two data storing tools, one to store the RateLimits information, and other to store the number of requests made by the user.

### RateLimits information - AppSettings:
  - To store the RateLimits information I chose to use the AppSettings file. 
  - AppSettings file is a Dictionary type file that is responsible to provide Key-value informations that can be used while the application is running. 
  - Once this file is treated as a Dictionary, we have constant time to Search for values on this file, if we have the key of them.
  - And another reason for this approach, is that is really easy to add new RateLimits information to the project, if we just add a new RateLimit called "Weather" the only change that is going to be made is that:
  
```json
"RateLimits": {
      "Status": {
        "Limit": 2,
        "TimePeriod": "00:01:00" // 1 minute
      },
      "News": {
        "Limit": 1,
        "TimePeriod": "1.00:00:00" // 1 day
      },
      "Marketing": {
        "Limit": 3,
        "TimePeriod": "01:00:00" // 1 hour
      },
      "Weather": {
        "Limit": 5,
        "TimePeriod": "00:05:00" // 5 minutes.
      }
    }
```
### Number of Already made Requests - Redis Distributed Cache:
  - To store the number of requests of the user, and update them when its needed, I chose Redis.
  - Redis has a few usabilities, and one of them is using it as a Distributed Cache.
  - For this solution I'm imagining that this Application is going to have thousands of concurrent requests per hour, so a robust database is needed.
  - So, If we have a horizontal scalling of the application, with multiple instances, we will still use the same Database for all the pods, ensuring that If a user make a request on the pod 1 and other request on pod 2, We will count both requests, 
  and the application won't allow a new Request in any other pod, if the limit for that type of Request is 2.
  - I chose Redis over MemoryCache of .NET because with MemoryCache we would have a new Cache for each instance of the app, enabling possible consistency errors.

## Possible Improvements:
- #### Add Integration Tests:
Unit Testing is really important but is not enough to ensure the quality of your code. On this project so far, I decided to add unit testing and Load testing, but Integration Tests would allow us to examine the interaction of all the modules of our notification flow together.
- #### Draw a C4 model diagram for the Project:
This project has only one endpoint which is responsible to call one use case, but having a c4 model diagram would help any other developer interested in maintain or develop a new feature on the project.
- #### Add unit Tests for the Validation Class created:
Once defined the business rules with the business team, I believe that having Unit tests for each rule defined for the fields of the Requests has a great value. This way we can ensure that only valid requests would be accepted and persisted.
  
## Conclusion:

- Using C# it is possible to create a Rate Limit App in many different ways, using many tools, what will define which tool you will choose in my point of view are 3 main concerns: 
    - the business rules 
    - the time you have to develop
    - the number of requests you expect to receive on that endpoint
- I chose Redis and AppSettings because with that approach the Application will handle thousands of concurrent requests, and It is really easy to Add a new Rate Limit type and observe the ones that are already in use. 
- If the RateLimit information becomes a sensitive data, I'd rather store this information on a SQL database over Redis, or even MongoDB if reading the data faster is more important than storing it faster. 
- Or even if cost reduction becomes a must, I'd rather using MemoryCache instead of Redis, once we donâ€™t need to download an image of Redis on Docker to use it, MemoryCache is a library provided from DotNet natively so there's no financial cost in using it.
